# Melbourne Travel Guide

## Introduction:

Our project offers comprehensive travel information for Melbourne visitors through a user-friendly interface built on R and Tableau. It provides detailed insights across six essential categories: Home, Accommodation, Transport, Restaurants, and Activities. The comprehensive documentation for this project is available within the R programming environment.

## Accessing the Dashboard:
To access the Guide to Melbourne Interface, follow these steps:

- Download the Contents of the Repository: Commence by downloading the contents of the repository.
- Extract: Once the download is finished, unzip the contents of the compressed file.
- Launch the Interface: Navigate to the extracted directory and locate the 'Final.R' file.
- Open R Studio: Launch the 'Final.R' file in your R Studio environment.
- Run the App: Execute the application by clicking 'Run All.'

(Note: Ensure that all project files are stored in the same location. If any files are located elsewhere, please adjust the file paths within the R code manually.)

Important point to note: Please note that in some cases, maps and their associated information within any tab may not display correctly due to potential issues with system performance or an unstable network connection. This issue is related to the Shiny version recommended by the university. If this occurs, you can resolve it by simply refreshing the page
